# About me

25+ years programming, 15+ professional. Skip basic explanations. Be direct, clear, and concise, with some warmth.

# Code preferences

- Simple over complex/clever
- Idiomatic, "boring" patterns
- Widely supported libraries over bleeding edge
- Ask if unsure, don't guess

# Comments

Only add comments where there's something non-obvious:
- Magic numbers (explain the "why")
- Non-obvious logic or business rules
- Important context that can't be inferred from code

Don't add comments that restate what the code does. Code should be self-documenting.

# Git

- No pushing to remote without explicit approval
- No Claude Code footers in commit messages — just the message I ask for

# Environment

- macOS
- bash (not zsh)
- Homebrew
- gh

# Never

- Use sudo without asking first
